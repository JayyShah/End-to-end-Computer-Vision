# Future Work:
1. AI-Powered Video Analytics
    - The power of computer vision on the edge brings a whole new dimension to video analytics. Shopping malls, convenience stores, restaurants, and brick-and-mortar stores can leverage object detection applications to detect people and store items. This helps them better understand shopper behavior and improve operations. Edge CV gives business managers access to real-time information that allows them to make improvements instantly, rather than days or weeks later.

    - Object detection helps retail operators intelligently track things like product interactions by analyzing how often customers stop at displays and what products they pick up or put back. Quick service restaurants can also benefit from CV by monitoring food preparation and order taking to ensure optimal speed of service

2. Contactless Checkout
    - Completely frictionless checkout systems are made possible with object detection. Through sensors and cameras powered by computer vision, shoppers simply pick items off the shelf and a 'virtual' shopping cart is created for that person with AI. Shoppers can then pay for those items at a contactless kiosk or simply walk out the door if a fully automated checkout system is being used.

3. Inventory Management
    - Computer vision is another set of eyes watching over every shelf in a store. Object detection applications trained to identify every item in a store’s inventory can instantly alert employees when items need to be restocked. CV helps stores better manage shelves and displays to make sure they are always stocked accurately and neatly.

    - Inventory control powered by artificial intelligence also allows managers to track product trends and order new products more seamlessly to meet future demands.

4. Foot Traffic Analysis
    - Object detection is a powerful tool for tracking activity inside and outside a store. CV applications that utilize tracking and counting can monitor and tally how many people enter and exit a store. It can also monitor foot traffic outside the store and count how many people walk by or stop to look at window displays.

# Customer Experience
The main goal of retail establishments is to provide the best customer experience possible. Object detection applications help accomplish that goal by providing valuable data on customer actions. For example, stores can improve the checkout process by monitoring for long lines. Once wait times exceed a certain threshold, employees can be automatically alerted to provide additional assistance. 

Computer vision applications can also identify when customers need assistance with product selection by identifying how long they look at items or if they pick up many different items without making a selection. Those actions can trigger an alert for employees to walk through those areas of the store to offer assistance.

# Industrial Use Case:

1. PPE Detection
    - Warehouses, manufacturing facilities, and construction sites can be dangerous places to work. So, innovative companies are always on the lookout for new technologies to increase employee safety. Object detection is the perfect solution for tracking the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).

    - Applications trained to detect hard hats, vests, goggles, face masks, or harnesses can be deployed throughout a facility to ensure employees are wearing correct PPE. If the system finds someone not wearing the right gear, an alert is sent to a supervisor to ensure the situation is corrected. 

2. Product Assembly
    - All manufacturers strive to produce products that meet quality standards and customer expectations. Computer vision is a valuable assistant in the manufacturing process. Object detection ensures the right components are used in assembly lines and correct processes are followed. It is also the tool that gives intelligent sight to robotics and other automated production systems. Many robotic systems are programmed to follow precise instructions but cannot deviate from that program. Robots with computer vision can detect a wider range of objects and be more adaptive to different environments.

3. Anomaly and Defect Detection
    - Precision and accuracy are paramount for manufactured products and goods. Object detection can identify parts and finished products that don’t meet quality standards. CV systems can constantly monitor workstations, production lines, and QC processes to identify products that are damaged or out of spec before they are shipped out the door. 

4. Productivity Improvement
    - Computer vision can boost productivity and efficiency, improving the bottom line. Object detection monitors workers in factories, warehouses, production facilities, and construction sites, providing valuable data on their work activities. It is important to note that workers can be tracked while also maintaining their individual privacy.

    - For example in construction, CV can monitor when workers enter a site and track their movements to map out the most efficient workspace. It’s a powerful tool for tracking and managing all forms of labor and subcontractors on-site - producing an accurate record of work and job progress.

# Transportation and Smart City

1. Traffic Monitoring & Road Maintenance
    - Object detection can also be used to monitor traffic and road conditions in smart cities. CV systems provide real-time data to transportation agencies about current traffic levels, potential hazards, and accidents. Object detection can be used to monitor different zones of a city. For instance, a city might have a core congestion zone that requires a permit for vehicles to enter. Object detection helps monitor those access points by identifying whether cars have the proper permits or by checking license plates against a database.

2. People Counting
    - Automatically counting people has many applications in smart cities and public spaces. It’s useful to track the total number of visitors to events or public attractions for safety and planning. Object detection can be used in transit systems to identify the most popular bus or subway stops and provide data on the route and capacity improvements.

    - People counting is also useful for stores and other businesses like museums to keep track of how many people enter and exit, monitoring specific areas to maintain desired capacity levels.

3. Parking Occupancy
    - Parking systems are becoming smarter with the help of computer vision. Object detection applications can identify open parking spaces in surface lots or parking garages.  Data can be updated in real-time, alerting drivers of open spots with signs.

4. In-Cabin Monitoring
    - As autonomous vehicles proliferate, computer vision will play a vital role in monitoring the inside of vehicles. With object detection and applications like pose estimation and eye tracking, computer vision systems can detect when drivers become drowsy or distracted on the road, sending them an alert to focus their attention.

    - CV can improve the riding experience on public transportation and autonomous mass transit systems. Object detection can alert operators of medical emergencies or other safety incidents - even when no driver is present.

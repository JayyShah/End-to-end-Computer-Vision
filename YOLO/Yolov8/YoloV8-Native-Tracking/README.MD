# YOLOV8 Tracking

- YOLOv8 Tracking is an enhanced version of the YOLO object detection system, with a strong emphasis on continuous, real-time tracking of objects in video feeds, adding a new dimension to its capabilities in the field of computer vision and artificial intelligence

# OverView

- YOLOv8 Tracking is a computer vision technology designed for object detection and tracking. YOLO is a popular real-time object detection system. YOLOv8 is an improved version of this system, known for its speed and accuracy.

The "Native Tracking" aspect in YOLOv8 refers to its capability to track objects in a video or real-time streaming environment seamlessly. Unlike traditional YOLO models, which only perform object detection per frame, YOLOv8 Native Tracking extends its functionality to track objects across frames. This is especially valuable in applications like surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and robotics, where maintaining the continuity of object tracking is crucial.

YOLOv8 Native Tracking leverages advanced deep learning techniques and neural networks to achieve real-time, high-precision tracking of objects, even in complex scenes. It helps identify and monitor objects of interest as they move within a video feed, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, including security, traffic management, and industrial automation.

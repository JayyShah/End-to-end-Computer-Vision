# Deploying Computer Vision Models Locally

## The Traditional Deployment Landscape
- Traditionally, deploying a computer vision model meant getting your hands dirty with Docker containers or investing in cloud-based services. While these methods have their merits, they also come with challenges:

**Cost Implications**: Cloud services come with ongoing expenses. As your application scales, so does your bill.
**Setup Complexities**: Configuring Docker can be a maze for newcomers.
**Latency and Offline Access Concerns**: Cloud-based methods can introduce latency, and without internet access, your model is unreachable.

# Using Inference to Deploy locally

**Cost-effective**: No ongoing cloud costs or hidden fees.
**Minimal setup**: Say goodbye to complex configurations.
**Reduced latency**: Process data in real-time on your local machine.
**Offline capabilities**: Your can inference against your models with or without the internet.

1. Install Dependencies

(`pip install inference`) - For Production use-cases, you'll likely use (`inference-gpu`)

- You will also need to install opencv-python to visualize images and predictions on screen:

(`pip install opencv-python`)

2. Choose the Model

- Example: Selecting the model to detect face from Images/WebCam

*For code kindly check image_inference.py file*

3. Inference on a WebCam (As per the Above Example)

*For code kindly check main.py file*

# Conclusion

-  It's a testament to the power of simplicity, and it empowers developers to deploy effortlessly. If you've been wrestling with complicated deployment setups.

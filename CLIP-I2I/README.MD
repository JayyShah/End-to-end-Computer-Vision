- The steps we will follow are:

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Import dependencies and download a dataset.
3. Calculate CLIP vectors for images in our dataset.
4. Create a vector database that stores our CLIP vectors.
5. Search the database.


## OverView

-  If you upload a photo of a scene in a particular environment, you can retrieve results with similar attributes to that scene. If you upload a photo of a particular object, you can find images with similar objects.

- We’ll build a search engine using COCO 128, a dataset with a wide range of different objects, to illustrate how CLIP makes it easy to search images using other images as an input.

# Features: 

- With This approach you can search for:
1. Exact duplicates to an image;
2. Near duplicates to an image, and;
3. Images that appear in a specific scene, or share attributes with the provided image, and more.

- The former two attributes can be used to check whether you already have images similar to a specific one in a dataset, and how many. The final attribute enables you to search a dataset by attributes in an image.

- Our search engine will be powered by “vectors”, or “embeddings”. Embeddings are “semantic” representations of an image, text, or other data. Embeddings are calculated by a machine learning model that has been trained on a wide range of data.

- Embeddings are “semantic” because they encode different features in an image, an attribute which enables comparing two embeddings to find the similarity of images. Similarity comparison is the backbone of image search.

- For our search engine, we will use CLIP embeddings. CLIP was trained on over 100 million images, and performs well for a range of image search use cases.

- To install Inference on your machine, refer to the official Inference installation instructions. Inference supports installation via pip and Docker.

- We are going to use the Docker installation method in this guide, which enables you to set up a central server for use in calculating CLIP embeddings. This is an ideal deployment option if you need to calculate a large number of vectors.

- (`docker pull roboflow/roboflow-inference-server-gpu`)

- Inference will run at (`http://localhost:9001`) when installed with Docker.
- There are a few more dependencies we need to install using pip:

(`pip install faiss-gpu supervision -q`) (For CUDA Enabled GPU, Replace GPU with CPU if you don't have CUDA Enabled)

# Conclusion

- In this guide, we built an image-to-image search engine with CLIP. This search engine can take an image as an input and return semantically similar images. We used CLIP to calculate embeddings for our search engine, and faiss to store them and run searches.

- This search engine could be used to find duplicate or similar images in a dataset. The former use case is useful for auditing a dataset. The latter use case could be presented as a search engine for a media archive, among many other use cases.
